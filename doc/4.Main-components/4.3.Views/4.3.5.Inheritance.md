# 4.3.5 - Inheritance - View component - Nucleon JS framework

You may want to create a hierarchy between views. Some would be parent of others, as a layout and content specific views. It is something really common. You can do it easily by declaring a view name or instance as a parent of another:

```javascript
// Declaring the layout, adding <child-views> tag defining where child views would be included
var layout = app.views.add('layout', {
    root: 'body',
    template: `
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-3"></div>
                <div class="col-sm-9">
                    <child-views></child-views>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    `
});
// Our content specific view
var view = app.views.add('new view', {
   parent: layout,
   template: '<div>Hello world!</div>'
});
view.render(); // Will render layout, then the view
```
